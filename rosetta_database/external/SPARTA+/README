What is SPARTA+?

SPARTA+ employs a well-trained neural network algorithm to make rapid chemical 
shift prediction on the basis of known structure. The input parameters for the 
neural network training procedure are similar to those used by the previous 
program SPARTA, hence the naming of this new program. The neural network is 
trained on a large carefully pruned database, containing 580 proteins for which 
high-resolution X-ray structures and nearly complete backbone and 13CB chemical 
shifts are available. The neural network is well trained to establish 
quantitative relations between chemical shifts and protein structures, 
including backbone and side-chain conformation, H-bonding, electric fields and 
ring-current effects. The trained neural network yields rapid and accurate 
chemical shift prediction for backbone and 13CB atoms.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reliability of SPARTA+

The reliability of SPARTA+ approach was tested by a three-fold 
training-and-validation procedure during the neural network training procedure, 
as well as by a second validation of eleven proteins which are not present in  
the training database, for which the RMS deviations between the SPARTA+ 
predicted and experimental shifts are 2.45, 1.09, 0.94, 1.14, 0.25 and 0.49 ppm 
for 15N, 13C', 13CA, 13CB, 1HA and 1HN, respectively.   


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Components of the SPARTA+ Package

The SPARTA+ program is implemented using C++. The compiled executable files 
($SPARTAP_DIR/bin/SPARTA+.linux for Linux, $SPARTAP_DIR/bin/SPARTA+.winxp for 
Windows, $SPARTAP_DIR/bin/SPARTA+.mac for Mac) or the starting script 
("$SPARTAP_DIR/sparta+" for Linux/Mac) can be invoked with command-line arguments. 
A complete list of options can be invoked and generated with a "-help" 
command-line argument. 

Use of SPARTA+ requires definition of an environment variable "SPARTAP_DIR" or a 
command-line argument "-spartaDir" to specify the SPARTA installation directory; 
it will be established automatically if run SPARTA from the starting script 
("$SPARTAP_DIR/sparta+" in Linux/Mac), which includes the following lines: 

   setenv SPARTAP_DIR /disk1/SPARTA+/
   $SPARTAP_DIR/bin/SPARTA+ $argv[1-$#argv]

Note that the definition of $SPARTAP_DIR in the starting script MUST be modified 
by users according to their SPARTA installation directory and the default 
"$SPARTA_DIR" is the current directory if not specified. 

Other files of the SPARTA+ package include: 


$SPARTAP_DIR/bin/SPARTA+.* 
The compiled SPARTA+ binary files for multiple platforms, such as Linux 
(SPARTA+.linux), MacOS (SPARTA+.mac), SGI (SPARTA+.sgi6x) and WindowsXP 
(SPARTA+.winxp). 

$SPARTAP_DIR/tab/randcoil.tab, rcadj.tab
The tables of random coil shifts and adjustments values used in the shifts 
prediction process. (The same tables as used in TALOS, 
http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/NMRPipe/talos/) 

$SPARTAP_DIR/tab/*level*.tab 
The weighting factors and biases of the neural network used in the prediction 
process.

How to Use SPARTA+


Use of SPARTA+ to predict backbone chemical shifts for one protein involves the 
following steps

1. Create a directory for the prediction session; all subsequent commands will 
be executed from this directory. 

2, Prepare an input PDB coordinate file (for example "protein.pdb"), according 
to the format given below. 

3. Run SPARTA+ to perform the chemical shifts calculation. Most commonly, this 
will simply require a command such as: 

   sparta+ -in protein.pdb

SPARTA+ will first generate in "pred" directory (defined by "-predDir" option) 
a "pred/protein_in.tab" file from PDB coordinates, which contains of the phi, 
psi, chi1 angles, H-bonding information and ring current shifts. Before exiting,
 a file "pred.tab" (defined by "-sum" option) will be created, this file 
includes a summary of the prediction results. The chemical shift calculation 
will typically take <1 second for a 100-residue protein on a Linux PC with a 
2.4GHz CPU. 
 

Use of SPARTA+ to predict backbone chemical shifts for multiple proteins 
involves the following steps

1. Create a directory for the prediction session; all subsequent commands will 
be executed from this directory. 

2. Prepare input PDB coordinate files (for example "protein1.pdb", ..., 
"proteinN.pdb"), according to the format given below. 

3. Run the following SPARTA+ command line 

   sparta+ -ins protein1.pdb protein2.pdb ... proteinN.pdb

to perform the chemical shifts calculation for each of the input proteins.

 

3. Use of SPARTA+ to identify possible chemical shift referencing offsets and 
chemical shift outliers

If the experimental chemical shifts for the target protein are available (with 
a name "ref.tab", for example, and with TALOS format), SPARTA+ prediction can 
be performed by a command such as: 

   sparta+ -in protein.pdb -ref ref.tab

SPARTA would compare the predicted chemical shifts and experimental shifts before 
exiting, and a prediction summary file "pred/pred.tab" will be generated to store 
both the experimental and SPARTA+ predicted shifts, along with the prediction 
errors. If the average prediction error for a given chemical shift type exceeds 
3 times expected errors (the standard deviation of the prediction errors divide 
the square root of the number of shifts), a warning will be printed and a 
reference correction will be applied to the experimental chemical shifts. The 
corrected experimental chemical shifts are stored into a new file "pred/ref.tab". 
A chemical shift outlier can also be identified if the predicted chemical shift 
(listed as column "SHIFT" in pred/pred.tab file) deviates its experimental shift 
(column "CS_OBS") by more than five standard deviation or prediction error 
(column "SIGMA").


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preparing the Input PDB Coordinates

The input PDB coordinates should be prepared carefully, so that it has the proper 
format and naming conventions. SPARTA+ accepts standard PDB coordinates file, but
 ONLY the FIRST conformer/chain will be used if more than one exist. For the PDB 
coordinates without hydrogen atoms, the hydrogen atoms are required to be added 
(by using the programs such as DYNAMO, REDUCE, MOLMOL, or any other similar 
programs) in order to get the hydrogen bonding information and ring current 
shifts. The standard "HA2/HA3" names are required for the GLY HA atoms.
