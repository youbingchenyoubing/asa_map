The packing problem: How should one place n points on a sphere so as to maximize the minimal distance between them? Arrangements (which we hope are close to optimal) are given for various values of n in the range 60 - 33002.

The covering problem: How should one place n points on a sphere so as to minimize the maximal distance of any point on the sphere from the closest one of the n points? This maximal distance is called the covering radius. Arrangements (which we hope are close to optimal) are given for various values of n in the range 72 - 78032.

The maximal volume problem: How should one place n points on a sphere so as to maximize the volume of their convex hull? Arrangements (which we hope are close to optimal) are given for various values of n in the range 72 - 78032.

these sphere covering sets satisfy the covering problem
